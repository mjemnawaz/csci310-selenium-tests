# HW-Cucumber

**Due:** Sept 16, 2020 by 10pm PT

**Goal:** familiarity with creating acceptance tests using Cucumber. Convert each use case (u) that you defined as part of HW3 into a fully automated acceptance test.

**References:** Cucumber information: https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/
                Selenium information: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/ and https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/

**Description:**
1. For each __u__:
     1. Implement all steps
     1. Ensure that the resulting acceptance test passes
1. Record a video with Zoom (in the cloud) of the execution of your acceptance tests
     1. Begin the video with running the Maven goal "cucumber" and show the Cucumber terminal output
     1. Copy the Zoom video link to the src/main/resources/video_link.txt file
     
**Notes:** If it is not possible to automate your use cases from HW3, then you can create and use new use cases, as necessary for HW7.  Please make a note in the new feature description that the use case differs from the one in HW3, so the graders are aware of the reason for the discrepancy.
